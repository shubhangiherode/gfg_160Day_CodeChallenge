problem : Move All Zeroes to End
  You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining 
  the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

  solution :
  // User function template for C++
class Solution {
  public:
    void pushZerosToEnd(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i] != 0){
                arr[count++] = arr[i];
            }
        }
        
        while (count < n) {
            arr[count++] = 0;
        }
    }
};

QIESTION : Given an array arr[] of integers and another integer target. Determine if there exist two distinct indices such that the sum of their elements is equal to the target.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2
Output: true
Explanation: arr[3] + arr[4] = -3 + 1 = -2
Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0
Output: false
Explanation: None of the pair makes a sum of 0
Input: arr[] = [11], target = 11
Output: false
Explanation: No pair is possible as only one element is present in arr[]
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105
-105 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
-2*105 ≤ target ≤ 2*105





SOLUTION : class Solution:
	def twoSum(self, arr, target):
		# code here
		seen = set()
		for num in arr:
		    complement = target - num
		    if complement in seen:
		        return True
		    seen.add(num)
	    return False

QUESTION : Given a string s consisting of lowercase English Letters. Return the first non-repeating character in s.
If there is no non-repeating character, return '$'.
Note: When you return '$' driver code will output -1.

Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 'f'
Explanation: In the given string, 'f' is the first character in the string which does not repeat.

Input: s = "aabbccc"
Output: -1
Explanation: All the characters in the given string are repeating.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 105


  SOLUTION : class Solution {
  public:
    char nonRepeatingChar(string &s) {
        // Your code here
        
        int freq[26] ={0};
        
        for (char ch :s){
            freq[ch - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for(char ch :s){
            if (freq [ch - 'a'] == 1)
            return ch;
        }
        
        return '$';
        
    }
};

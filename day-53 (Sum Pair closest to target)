QUESTION : Given an array arr[] and a number target, find a pair of elements (a, b) in arr[], where a<=b whose sum is closest to target.
Note: Return the pair in sorted order and if there are multiple such pairs return the pair with maximum absolute difference. If no such pair exists return an empty array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 30, 20, 5], target = 25
Output: [5, 20]
Explanation: As 5 + 20 = 25 is closest to 25.
Input: arr[] = [5, 2, 7, 1, 4], target = 10
Output: [2, 7]
Explanation: As (4, 7) and (2, 7) both are closest to 10, but absolute difference of (2, 7) is 5 and (4, 7) is 3. Hence, [2, 7] has maximum absolute difference and closest to target. 
Input: arr[] = [10], target = 10
Output: []
Explanation: As the input array has only 1 element, return an empty array.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 2*105
0 <= target<= 2*105
0 <= arr[i] <= 105






SOLUTION : #User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def sumClosest(self, arr, target):
        # code here
        
        n = len(arr)
        if n < 2:
            return []
            
        arr.sort()
        left = 0
        right = n -1
        
        closest_diff = float('inf')
        max_abs_diff = -1
        result = []
        
        while left < right:
            a = arr[left]
            b = arr[right]
            
            if a > b:
                left += 1
                continue
            
            current_sum = a + b
            diff = abs(current_sum - target)
            
            if diff < closest_diff or (diff == closest_diff and abs (a-b) > max_abs_diff):
                closest_diff = diff
                max_abs_diff = abs(a - b)
                result = [a,b]
                
            if current_sum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
                
        
        return result
